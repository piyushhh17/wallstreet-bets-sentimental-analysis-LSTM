# wallstreet bets sentimental analysis LSTM
 This is a sentiment analysis of r/wallstreetbets to identify the positive sentiment stocks. I have used LSTM neural network to make a classification model that can binary classify the posts from the subreddit into negative and positive based on the sentiment.
 I have trained the model over a labeled dataset and have enhanced the efficiency upto 92 percent.
 The model uses Long- short term neural network for classification.
 I have used keras library to efficiently train the model.
 To further display the current price of the stocks I have used Yfinance and Tkinter.
